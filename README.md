# My dwm build
This repository contains the patches, source code for dwm, and the actual code for my dwm build.

This repo depends on a lot of things on /usr/bin and /opt/ directories, hardware and packages being available. I suggest you to create soft symbolic links of my archives to the needed directories.

Hope you like my beautiful creation! ![](https://github.com/renanwp2/My-dwm-build/blob/main/images/github.png)
